你们脚本小子整天扫网站有意思吗?扫之前不做个指纹识别一下? Awvs扫静态网站是不是有病，能扫出个鬼啊，静态网站连后台都没有，真不知道扫啥玩意儿
另外网站有日志的知道吗, Awvs特征这么明显，你服务器高匿名了吗?非法扫描入侵违法的知道吗?真要扫搞个多层高匿服务器再来吧，虽然最后还是扫不出啥玩意。
Do you script kiddies have fun scanning websites all day? Don't do a fingerprint recognition before scanning? AWVS scan static .
website is not sick, can scan a ghost, static website does not even have a background, I really don't know what to scan
n addition, do you know that the website has logs? The AWVS feature is so obvious. Is your server highly anonymous? Do you know
that illegal scanning is illegal? I really want to sweep up a multi-layer high-secret server and come back, although I still
can't find anything in the end.
